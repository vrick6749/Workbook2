Assessment 2

# Question 1 (https://adrianmejia.com/ruby-on-rails-architectural-design/)

Rails is a web application development framework which adheres to a rule of convention over configuration. This allows programmers to be more productive as structure of the program is prefabricated allowing for more time to focus on the programs content. The rails framework is comprised of the model, view and controller also known as MVC. The model contains the logic of data being handled by the code framework. It allows for the manipulation and validation of data being stored as well as being passed to and from the client. The view is concerned with rendering the data from the server into a meaningful "view" for the end client. 

Apart from convention over configuration, rails philosophy also involves the DRY principle. DRY, which stands for do not repeat yourself encourages programmers to reduce the lines of code they write, by developing unambiguous code, which can be reused throughout the program. This allows for a less buggy, easy to maintain and efficient code.


# Question 2

https://www.aalpha.net/blog/pros-and-cons-of-using-postgresql-for-application-development/

Database management systems enables users to store, create, retrieve, edit and delete data. DBMS allows for data independece, which permits for a logical schema to be modified, without affecting the structure of the next level data structure. Data independence also means that data is stored at a different location rather than within the application, allowing for more versatile use of data and a more portable and efficient application. 
An example of a widely used database management system is postgresql.

Postgresql has several benefits compared to other databases such as, transactional DDL, extensibility and security. A transactional DDL is concerned with a group of operations observing ACIDity (atomic, consistent, isolated and durable) being treated as a single operation. This grouping of transactions enable better responsiveness and flexibility to application problems, as programmers will be able to rollback to a previous working code and resolve the issue, without interrupting the functionality and accessibility of the entire application. Extensibility refers to the ability of postgresql to install multiple extensions allowing the user to execute additional functions, that may not even be the main language used by the programmer, which does not pose as a problem since postgresql handles the functionality automatically.
Security wise  postgresql provides parameter based security wherein database can be locked down at an OS level. Application security is also delivered through the basis of segregated user privileges.

Some of postgresql's limitations involve a strict database structure, wherein a schema cannot consist of new data until it's column has been defined prior to addition. This structure may also lead to a slower performace when running a query on a large scale databse, as the query will have to be run through numerous rows and columns. Postgresql is also an open source software, which means it is run by the community, this implies a lack of warranty and indemnity protection.

# Question 3 (https://www.smartsheet.com/comprehensive-guide-values-principles-agile-manifesto)
<!-- Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology	 -->

Agile is a methodology which adheres to four values. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools, promotes a smoother flow of communication between team members and customers allowing for faster reactions when change must be done to a project, as in the case of process these conversations will be scheduled and may be limited to specific topics of discussion making reactions to changes sluggish.

 Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation,


  Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
  
  
   and Responding to Change Over Following a Plan.
