Assessment 2

# Question 1 (https://adrianmejia.com/ruby-on-rails-architectural-design/)

Rails is a web application development framework which adheres to a rule of convention over configuration. This allows programmers to be more productive as structure of the program is prefabricated allowing for more time to focus on the programs content. The rails framework is comprised of the model, view and controller also known as MVC. The model contains the logic of data being handled by the code framework. It allows for the manipulation and validation of data being stored as well as being passed to and from the client. The view is concerned with rendering the data from the server into a meaningful "view" for the end client. 

Apart from convention over configuration, rails philosophy also involves the DRY principle. DRY, which stands for do not repeat yourself encourages programmers to reduce the lines of code they write, by developing unambiguous code, which can be reused throughout the program. This allows for a less buggy, easy to maintain and efficient code.


# Question 2

Database management systems enables users to store, create, retrieve, edit and delete data. It is the middleman of the application a user is utilizing and the database of where they opted to store their information. A frequently used DBMS is postgresql. This database management system has numerous upsides, such as transactional DDL, extensibility, opensource long term support, ability to handle large amounts of data. Cons slow speeds with larger database as data is sifted by rows, being open source means no warranty and liability or indemnity protection, schema is strict and not as flexible as noSQL database, which has no immediate structure.

# Question 3 (https://www.smartsheet.com/comprehensive-guide-values-principles-agile-manifesto)
<!-- Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology	 -->

Agile is a methodology which adheres to four values. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools, promotes a smoother flow of communication between team members and customers allowing for faster reactions when change must be done to a project, as in the case of process these conversations will be scheduled and may be limited to specific topics of discussion making reactions to changes sluggish.
